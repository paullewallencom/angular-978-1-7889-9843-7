Built-in Validators & Using HTML5 Validation
Which Validators do ship with Angular 

Check out the Validators class httpsangular.ioapiformsValidators - these are all built-in validators, though that are the methods which actually get executed (and which you later can add when using the reactive approach).

For the template-driven approach, you need the directives. You can find out their names, by searching for validator in the official docs httpsangular.ioapitype=directive - everything marked with D is a directive and can be added to your template.

Additionally, you might also want to enable HTML5 validation (by default, Angular disables it). You can do so by adding the ngNativeValidate  to a control in your template.
