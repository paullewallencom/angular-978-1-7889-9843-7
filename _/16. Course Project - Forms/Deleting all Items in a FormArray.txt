Deleting all Items in a FormArray
As of Angular 8, there's a new way of clearing all items in a FormArray.

(FormArraythis.recipeForm.get('ingredients')).clear();
The clear() method automatically loops through all registered FormControls (or FormGroups) in the FormArray and removes them.

It's like manually creating a loop and calling removeAt() for every item.
